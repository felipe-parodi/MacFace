*MacFace == PrimateFace*

Understanding primate social communication and affective states requires precise detection and tracking of facial landmarks, which present unique challenges in non-human primates. Here, we introduce PrimateFace, an unprecedented cross-species primate dataset containing over 230,000 images, with extensive diversity and challenging natural settings.

### Directories
data: This directory contains the PrimateFace dataset, which includes over 250,000 images of myriad primate species, providing a challenging benchmark for primate face analysis. It also includes any relevant data files used in the project.

docs: This directory contains the paper detailing our methodology, results, and analysis. It also contains any other relevant documentation for the project.

results: This directory contains the output data and analysis results generated by the scripts in the "src" directory.

scripts: This directory contains the code for the models for performing face detection and keypoint tracking. It also includes any utility scripts or libraries used.

src: This directory contains the source code for the project, including the models, training and testing scripts, and any other relevant code.

tests: This directory contains scripts for testing the functionality and performance of the models.

### Model
Our cutting-edge MegaPrimateFace models, utilizing transformer and lightweight real-time architectures, exhibit robust performance and generalizability across tasks, surpassing previous benchmarks in size, species diversity, and cross-species generalizability

### Dataset
To promote further research in the field of primate face analysis, we open-source our dataset and models. Fine-tuned models and Google Colab notebook tutorials are also provided to foster further research in primate face analysis.
