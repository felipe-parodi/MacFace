# MacFace: A Cross-Species Primate Dataset and Multi-Task Vision Transformer for Face Analysis
The ability to detect and recognize non-human primates has crucial implications in fields such as wildlife conservation and behavioral research. In this project, we present MacFace, a novel cross-species primate dataset and a cutting-edge multi-task vision transformer for face detection, segmentation, and keypoint tracking.

### Directories
data: This directory contains the MacFace dataset, which includes over 250,000 images of myriad primate species, providing a challenging benchmark for primate face analysis. It also includes any relevant data files used in the project.

docs: This directory contains the paper detailing our methodology, results, and analysis. It also contains any other relevant documentation for the project.

results: This directory contains the output data and analysis results generated by the scripts in the "src" directory.

scripts: This directory contains the code for the multi-task transformer, which is capable of jointly performing face detection, segmentation, keypoint tracking, and recognition. It also includes any utility scripts or libraries used.

src: This directory contains the source code for the project, including the models, training and testing scripts, and any other relevant code.

tests: This directory contains scripts for testing the functionality and performance of the models.

### Model
Our multi-task vision transformer is capable of jointly performing all three tasks, achieving competitive results on each individual task. We evaluate our model on MacFace and on two benchmark datasets, WIDERFace, FDDB, demonstrating its superior performance and generalizability when pre-trained on the MacFace dataset. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze the impact of different image sets, such as different species or synthetically generated images.

### Dataset
To promote further research in the field of primate face analysis, we open-source both our dataset and model. By providing a comprehensive benchmark dataset, as well as a powerful multi-task vision transformer, this work will facilitate the advancement of research in primate face analysis and improve our understanding and conservation of these vital species.
